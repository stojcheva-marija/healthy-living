			<p id="text">I’m thin. I’ve been thin my whole life. Tall and thin.</br>
				<p id="text2">I am not going to complain, but this isn’t always easy. Even though the society idealizes thin bodies, I’ve taken my share of verbal abuse over the years. The idea of skiny-shaming is still very controversial, and people don’t find it inappropriate to approach a thin girl and tell her to “Go eat a hamburger”. Apparently, no one would go up to a fat person and tell them “Do you ever stop eating?”.
				I was told that I am skinny since I was a child, but I didn’t pay attention to it until I became a teenager. Throughout my whole childhood, I always had some type of physical activity such as basketball, latino and hip-hop dance, volleyball, aerobics, boxing…  In 3rd year od high school I worked on a project that was very important to me and stopped doing sports. I didn’t put up any weight, but I was less toned. One of my friends told me that I wasn’t as skinny as before as that was a bad thing. That affected me mentally really bad. I didn’t want to eat anything and I lost 15kg in 2months. I was extremely skinny and my health was at risk. I wasn’t able to look myself at a mirror and was disguised by food at the same time. Then, I was told that I look too skinny. The body-shaming that others did to me didn’t hurt me at the moment, but has done much bigger damage to me. They made me body-shame myself and not be happy at my own skin, which is much worse.
				It took me quite a lot of time to overcome the obstacles I had in my had and to start EAT ENOUGH. Being fit and skinny is not the same. I started working out a lot, eat properly and felt immediately better. It’s important to stay consistent and changes will happen for sure.
				Since I am finally happy and I know how important it is to be confident in your own skin, I designed these colorful calculators to help you with your journeys. Be stronger than your strongest excuse. Be proud of who you are, not ashamed of how someone else sees you.
